# Natural Language Interface Specification (NLIS) Protocol

The Natural Language Interface Specification (NLIS) Protocol is a language-agnostic, human-readable format designed to facilitate the communication between developers, designers, and AI systems during the design and development process of user interfaces. The primary goal of NLIS is to enable the generation of code or visual mockups from a simple and intuitive description of user interfaces.
## Key Features
- Simple, structured, and human-readable format
- High-level abstractions for describing user interfaces
- Facilitates collaboration between humans and AI systems
- Encourages a modular approach to interface design with reusable components

## Getting Started

To understand the NLIS protocol, it's best to start by reviewing the [NLIS documentation](documentation.md) . This document provides an in-depth explanation of the protocol, its various components, and examples.
## Example

An example NLIS specification can be found in the [example folder](/examples)  of this repository. This example demonstrates a simple login screen described using the NLIS protocol.
## Specification

The NLIS specification is divided into three main sections: 
1. [Metadata](documentation.md#metadata) 
2. [Layout](documentation.md#layout) 
3. [Events](documentation.md#events)

Each section serves a specific purpose in describing user interfaces. Refer to the [documentation](documentation.md)  for more details.
## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the NLIS protocol. Please feel free to submit issues, pull requests, or contact us directly to discuss any improvements, ideas, or concerns.
## License

The NLIS protocol is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
